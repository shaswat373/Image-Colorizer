# Image Colorizer (Deep Learning)

This project implements an image colorization pipeline using a convolutional neural network (CNN). It takes a grayscale image as input and generates a colorized version as output.

## Features
- Pre-trained model on the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Accepts user-uploaded grayscale images (32x32)
- Produces side-by-side visualization of input and colorized output
